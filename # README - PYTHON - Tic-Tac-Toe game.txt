create a simple tic tac toe game in python
ChatGPT
Absolutely, let's create a simple Tic Tac Toe game in Python! â˜º This game will be played in the console between two players. Here's a simple approach:

Initialize the Board: We'll start with a 3x3 grid represented by a list of lists.
Display the Board: Function to print the current state of the board.
Take Player Input: Function to allow players to place their mark (X or O) on the board.
Check Win or Tie: Function to check if a player has won or if the game is a tie.
Switch Player: After each move, switch the active player from X to O or vice versa.
Main Game Loop: Loop through these steps until the game is won or ends in a tie.
Let's code this! â˜º

python
Copy code
def initialize_board():
    return [[" " for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]

def print_board(board):
    for row in board:
        print("|".join(row))
        print("-" * 5)

def check_win(board, player):
    win_conditions = [
        [board[0][0], board[0][1], board[0][2]],
        [board[1][0], board[1][1], board[1][2]],
        [board[2][0], board[2][1], board[2][2]],
        [board[0][0], board[1][0], board[2][0]],
        [board[0][1], board[1][1], board[2][1]],
        [board[0][2], board[1][2], board[2][2]],
        [board[0][0], board[1][1], board[2][2]],
        [board[2][0], board[1][1], board[0][2]],
    ]
    return [player, player, player] in win_conditions

def check_tie(board):
    return all(all(cell != " " for cell in row) for row in board)

def take_turn(board, player):
    while True:
        try:
            row = int(input(f"{player}'s turn. Enter row (0-2): "))
            col = int(input(f"{player}'s turn. Enter column (0-2): "))
            if board[row][col] == " ":
                board[row][col] = player
                break
            else:
                print("This spot is already taken.")
        except (ValueError, IndexError):
            print("Please enter a valid row and column.")

def switch_player(player):
    return "O" if player == "X" else "X"

def play_game():
    board = initialize_board()
    current_player = "X"
    while True:
        print_board(board)
        take_turn(board, current_player)
        if check_win(board, current_player):
            print_board(board)
            print(f"Congratulations! {current_player} wins!")
            break
        elif check_tie(board):
            print_board(board)
            print("It's a tie!")
            break
        current_player = switch_player(current_player)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    play_game()
To play the game, run this script in your Python environment. Players will be prompted to enter the row and column where they want to place their mark, with the top-left corner being (0,0) and the bottom-right corner being (2,2). Have fun playing! ðŸŽ®ðŸ˜Š
